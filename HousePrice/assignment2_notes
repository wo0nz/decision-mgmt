Explore the dataset:
1. Initial set of questions
-
"Commercial companies that work in the real estate field has started using big data solutions to reduce their fincancial risks." 
What financial risk mitigation inference is possible with this dataset?  


2. Provide insights gained from using Cognos Analytics
(Outliers?, Missing variables for some cases? Irrelevant variables?)
Recommended solutions:

How does Cognos Analytics provide assistance?


An initial and critical step in any data analysis and machine learning project is wrangling and cleaning of the data. 

Outliers in real estate data could be due to a number of reasons. For example, erroneous data formats, bad default values, typographical errors during data entry etc. can lead to outliers. Plotting the distribution of numeric columns can give a sense of outliers in the data set.


3. New specific questions which provide additional insights into and answer specific questions from the dataset. Discuss how these insights could be useful. Discuss how you would improve relevancy.


4. Develop and explain at least five different visualizations (experiment with the available options and summarize the results ( what do they show ): 


5. Utilize features (e.g., filters, comparisions) with the visualizations to uncover and explain interesting aspects of the dataset.



6. Create and expalin at least one insightful calculation. Discuss why this would be useful.
